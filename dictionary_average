# The provided code stub will read in a dictionary containing key/value pairs of name:[marks] for a list of students. 
# Print the average of the marks array for the student name provided, showing 2 places after the decimal.

# Example:
     marks key: value pairs are
    'alpha': [20,30,40]
    'beta': [30,50,70]
    query_name = 'beta'

# The query_name is 'beta'. beta's average score is (20+50+70)/3 = 50.

# Input Format:
# The first line contains the integer n, the number of students' records. The next n lines contain the names and marks obtained by a student, each value separated by a space. 
# The final line contains query_name, the name of a student to query.
